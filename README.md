pele
====

Python port of https://github.com/markitondemand/MOD.Web.Element

Python + Element = Pele

Pele is the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes;

She is featured in the logo, which is based on the Rhombus shape of the MOD.Element logo

If Pele is different than its Element, here's how:
*   Casing
  *     Uses lower-case in many places
*   jQuery method aliases where applicable 
  *     For developers with non-Element background
*   Actual classes for DOM elements like 'a', 'input'
  *     Will eventually add validation methods and element-specific methods
*   Simpler; parts removed:
  *     If Python doesn't have construct (like interface)
  *     If I don't see the need (like properties)
