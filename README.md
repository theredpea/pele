pele
====

Python port of https://github.com/markitondemand/MOD.Web.Element

Python + Element = Pele

Pele is the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes.

If it's different, here's how:
Casing; uses lower-case
jQuery method names where applicable
Simpler; parts removed:
  If Python doesn't have construct (like interface)
  If I don't see the need (like properties)
